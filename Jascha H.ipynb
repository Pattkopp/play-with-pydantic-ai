      "\n",
      "- Demand intake and prioritization\n",
      "  - Non-standard or incomplete specs from requesters; scope changes mid-cycle.\n",
      "  - Urgent outage/turnaround needs overriding planned sourcing and approvals.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cross-entity sourcing model\n",
      "  - Handoffs to internal service providers (e.g., IT) create queueing and unclear SLAs.\n",
      "  - Confusion over which entity should source what; cross-charge alignment issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stakeholder alignment and approvals\n",
      "  - Long approval chains and complex delegation-of-authority thresholds; approver unavailability across time zones.\n",
      "  - Maverick/off-contract buying when users are under time pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Data and system fragmentation\n",
      "  - Multiple ERPs/tools across group companies; duplicate vendor records and inconsistent item masters.\n",
      "  - Limited, delayed spend visibility; heavy reliance on spreadsheets and manual reconciliations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sourcing cycle inefficiencies\n",
      "  - Time-consuming RFI/RFPs; apples-to-oranges bids due to spec ambiguity.\n",
      "  - Limited competition for OEM/sole-source items; long commercial/legal negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Contracting bottlenecks\n",
      "  - Iterative redlines on LDs, indemnities, warranties, and IP; slow turnaround with Legal and suppliers.\n",
      "  - Poor contract metadata and repository hygiene; contract leakage and missed renewals.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Supplier onboarding and qualification\n",
      "  - Lengthy KYC/sanctions, HSE prequalification, insurance, and bank validation steps.\n",
      "  - Repetition of onboarding across group entities; small/local suppliers struggle with documentation portals.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Risk, compliance, and ESG\n",
      "  - Sanctions/export controls, local content rules, modern slavery, and HSE compliance tracking.\n",
      "  - Scope 3/ESG data collection from suppliers is low quality and manual.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Supplier management\n",
      "  - Limited bandwidth for SRM/QBRs; inconsistent KPI tracking (OTIF, quality, safety).\n",
      "  - Tail-spend proliferation and difficulty capturing supplier-led innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Inventory and critical spares\n",
      "  - Setting/maintaining min-max for critical spares; obsolescence and SLOB stock.\n",
      "  - Long OEM lead times and frequent expediting for unplanned failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Logistics and international trade\n",
      "  - Incoterms misunderstandings, customs clearance delays, import permits, and demurrage.\n",
      "  - Documentation errors (certs, origin, HS codes) leading to rework.\n",
      "\n",
      "- P2P and invoicing\n",
      "  - Outdated catalogs and price lists; change orders and service entry sheet backlogs.\n",
      "  - High 3-way/4-way match exceptions; field ticket reconciliation; month-end accrual firefighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Project (CapEx/EPC) procurement\n",
      "  - Alignment to WBS and budgets; change orders/claims management.\n",
      "  - Milestone payments, bonds/guarantees, LDs; FAT/QA/QC scheduling and document control.\n",
      "\n",
      "- IT/cyber reviews for vendors\n",
      "  - Security/privacy assessments delay SaaS and OT/ICS suppliers; additional contractual riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Resource and time constraints\n",
      "  - Too much tactical firefighting vs. strategic category work.\n",
      "  - Training end users on processes and tools; chasing approvals and documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reporting and analytics\n",
      "  - Manual KPI and savings tracking; inconsistent taxonomy/category coding.\n",
      "  - Budget vs. actual variance analysis and demand forecasting are ad hoc.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Governance and audit readiness\n",
      "  - Tender committee scheduling, segregation-of-duties constraints, and exception documentation.\n",
